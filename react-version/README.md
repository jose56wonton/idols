# Idols
This is a site that is super personal. 

For a long time I have pursued many things.

And I have finally found what is truely worthy of pursuit.

### Process
Initially I was working with Gatsby, but I found that was not what I wanted to use and eventually switch back to plain react

### New Technology/Concepts Learned
* Gatsby.js
* Typography.js
* CSS Modules (I know... it's about time)
* CSS Transitions/Animations/Keyframes
